Project Midas collects relevant tweets about the specified stock and runs a sentiment analysis to identify if public opinion
on the company is postive or negative. It then makes a prediction for tomorrow's stock price by analyzing historical stock 
price data from the last 20 days and running them through the radial basis function (RBF) which is a type of support vector
used in machine learning and neural nets. This project was made using the web development framework python flask along with
the scikit-learn machine learning library and the twitter api.
